# Task by Frequent Research

## Stack
1. React.js
2. Node.js
3. Express.js
4. MongoDB

## Approach
Due to time constraints, I am not able to deploy it because most of the server are not working currently.
But I have made the app from end to end. Every feature is included

## Setup
1. Clone the app
2. Run these command:
`cd backend`
`npm run dev`
Make another terminal and run:
`cd frontend`
`npm run dev`

3. Then visit `http://localhost:5173`
